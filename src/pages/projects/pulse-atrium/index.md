## Details

The **Georgia Tech Atrium**, based in **New York City**, aims to **transform** to the various needs of its patrons as well as **resonate** with them **programmatically** and **socially**.

## Introduction

As a team comprised of two industrial design students and two architecture students, we developed a concept for an **interactive environment** that promotes and facilitates **continued education and growth**.

This initiative originated from the executive team at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, and became the basis for our semester-long studio project. Our goal was to **identify the primary and secondary stakeholders** for our solution, **gather insights** through user research, and use those insights to **drive our solution**.

## Contributions

On this team, my primary contributions included **conducting interviews** with stakeholders, **developing user experience flows** for spatial interactions, **designing graphic collateral** for digital and physical presentations, **creating detailed and realistic still renderings** of elements of the atrium space, and **rendering complex yet clear animations** of the various interaction scenarios.

## Research

We began by identifying a wide variety of **potential stakeholders** that may be affected by the prospect of an open educational space. From there, we narrowed down our list to a handful of stakeholders we specifically wanted to focus on, and created **personas** for each one.

## Rationalization

After **reaching out** to actual people that fell into our stakeholder groups and **interviewing them**, we then took this a step further by developing a **stakeholder map**. This map outlines the various **actions** each stakeholder could potentially want to do in the space, the types og **services** and **contexts** that facilitate those actions, as well as the **resources** they may utilize.

## Storyboards

The insights we gained from our interviews with users allowe dus to develop in-depth **storyboards** that outline a few typical interactions that we wanted to include within the space.

## Solution

After multiple interactions, we were able to visualize a **programmatic solution** to address many of the stakeholder needs through **renderings** of the space and **animations** that describe detailed scenarios.
