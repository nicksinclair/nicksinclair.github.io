Our goal was to <strong>identify the primary and secondary stakeholders</strong> for our solution, <strong>gather insights</strong> through user research, and use those insights to <strong>drive our solution</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>On this team, my primary contributions included <strong>conducting interviews</strong> with stakeholders, <strong>developing user experience flows</strong> for spatial interactions, <strong>designing graphic collateral</strong> for digital and physical presentations, <strong>creating detailed and realistic still renderings</strong> of elements of the atrium space, and <strong>rendering complex yet clear animations</strong> of the various interaction scenarios.</p>\n<h2>The Warehouse</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/pulse_01.png\" alt=\"The Warehouse\"></p>\n<p>The Warehouse | 520 W 20th Street New York City, NY</p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p>We began by identifying a wide variety of <strong>potential stakeholders</strong> that may be affected by the prospect of an open educational space. From there, we narrowed down our list to a handful of stakeholders we specifically wanted to focus on, and created <strong>personas</strong> for each one.</p>\n<h2>Futures Students</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/persona_future_student.png\" alt=\"Future Student\"></p>\n<h2>Online Students</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/persona_online_student.png\" alt=\"Online Student\"></p>\n<h2>Alumni</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/persona_alumni.png\" alt=\"Alumni\"></p>\n<h2>Rationalization</h2>\n<p>After <strong>reaching out</strong> to actual people that fell into our stakeholder groups and <strong>interviewing them</strong>, we then took this a step further by developing a <strong>stakeholder map</strong>. This map outlines the various <strong>actions</strong> each stakeholder could potentially want to do in the space, the types og <strong>services</strong> and <strong>contexts</strong> that facilitate those actions, as well as the <strong>resources</strong> they may utilize.</p>\n<h2>Stakeholder Map</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/stakeholder_map.png\" alt=\"Stakeholder Map\"></p>\n<h2>Storyboards</h2>\n<p>The insights we gained from our interviews with users allowe dus to develop in-depth <strong>storyboards</strong> that outline a few typical interactions that we wanted to include within the space.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/storyboard_future_student.png\" alt=\"Future Student Storyboard\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/storyboard_online_student.png\" alt=\"Online Student Storyboard\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/storyboard_alumni.png\" alt=\"Alumni Storyboard\"></p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>After multiple interactions, we were able to visualize a <strong>programmatic solution</strong> to address many of the stakeholder needs through <strong>renderings</strong> of the space and <strong>animations</strong> that describe detailed scenarios.</p>\n<h2>Innovation Theater | Interior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/innovation_theater_interior.png\" alt=\"Innovation Theater Interior\"></p>\n<h2>Cell Interior</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/cell_interior.png\" alt=\"Cell Interior\"></p>\n<h2>Cell Reservation</h2>\n<video width='320' controls>\n  <source src='./video/cell_reservation.mp4' type='video/mp4'>\n</video>\n<h2>Maker's Space</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/makers_space.png\" alt=\"Maker&#x27;s Space\"></p>\n<h2>Social Bar</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/social_bar.png\" alt=\"Social Bar\"></p>\n<h2>Interactive Pop-Up</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/interactive_pop-up.png\" alt=\"Interactive Pop-Up\"></p>\n<h2>Exterior Installations</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/exterior_01\" alt=\"Exterior 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/exterior_02\" alt=\"Exterior 2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./images/exterior_03\" alt=\"Exterior 3\"></p>\n<h2>Site and Structure</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./images/site_structure\" alt=\"Site and Structure\"></p>\n<h2>Video Presentation</h2>\n<video controls>\n  <source src='./video/pulse.mp4' type='video/mp4'>\n</video>","frontmatter":{"path":"/projects/pulse-atrium","date":"2019-06","title":"Pulse Atrium","author":"Nick Sinclair"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
